#Results Tracker - Web

This project is the web component of our Results Tracker application. 
The mobile code is located [here](https://github.com/torgrimsonja/ResultsTrackerMobile).

This project is under active, private development and is not accepting public contributors.

##Nathan's Tasks (and questions, I guess)

- Important
	- Display progress data on `reports.php` using [Highcharts JS](http://www.highcharts.com)
		- Show all students and click to view reports, maybe?
	- Create CRUD functions for attempts
	- Create account (will this happen on mobile or web?)
	- buttons to edit and delete courses from `courses.php?action=viewCourse`.
	- ability to assign task to course (probably from same page as item above)
	- Finish inputting all default tasks (did I finish doing that?)
	- Finish writing CRUD for Task Management


- Not-so Important
	- Error message when incorrect login is entered
	- What is the difference between Reports and progress (on main page)?
	- Eliminate all buttons on `index.php` page, show little blurb about app (w/ link to store), and have another link to log in in main content page
	- make logging out redirect to home page (it breaks the interface when you are in any other page)
